# Lab exercise 12 objectives
1. Write C++ programs
2. Compile C++ programs
3. Implement programs that use pointers and objects

# Additional Reading
This lab exercise will require you to store function prototypes and implementations in separate files. Kindly go through [this tutorial](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/function-file-organization) before starting the lab exercise.

# Instructions
Answer the programming problems sequentially (i.e., answer prob01 before prob02). If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates. However, take note that asking questions will "reset" your three-right-in-a-row count.

When you answer three programming problems correctly in a row or when you finish answering all ten problems, let your instructor know and wait for further instruction.
